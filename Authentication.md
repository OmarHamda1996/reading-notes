## Safely Hashing and Storing Passwords

To safely hash and store a password:

1. Use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
2. Apply the hashing function to the password and store the resulting hash.
3. When users log in, compare the hashed entered password with the stored hash.

Bcrypt is a trusted algorithm designed for password hashing. It incorporates a salt and multiple rounds of hashing to make it hard for attackers to guess passwords.

## Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple method to provide credentials in an HTTP request. The necessary properties in the request header are the "Authorization" field, which indicates the request requires authentication, and the "Authorization" value in the format "Basic [credentials]". The username:password pair in Basic Auth is encoded using Base64.

## Define the Authentication Process

The authentication process verifies the identity of users before granting them access to specific resources or features within an application.

1. Users provide their username and password.
2. The application checks if the provided credentials match the stored information.
3. If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access.
4. If the credentials are incorrect, access is denied.

## Error Messaging

Error messaging in authentication should provide minimal information to prevent potential attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **HTTP Response:** Use appropriate status codes (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) to indicate authentication failures without revealing specific details.

- **HTML Error Pages:** Avoid displaying sensitive information and use generic error messages to maintain security.
