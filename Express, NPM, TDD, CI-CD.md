# An introduction to NodeJS and Express

## Middleware
Middleware is like a plugin or filter that adds extra functionality to a web application. It helps process and modify incoming requests and outgoing responses.

## Express
Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features to build web applications easily and efficiently. 

Express being "unopinionated" means that it doesn't enforce a specific way of doing things. Developers have the freedom to choose the components, libraries, and architecture that best suit their needs.

## Module
A module is a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific task. It helps organize and reuse code, making development easier and more efficient. Modularity allows developers to break down an application into smaller, manageable parts.

## What is NPM?

What version of npm are you running on your machine?
- 9.6.6

What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint' into your node project?
- `npm install jshint`

## What is TDD?

Tests are important because they ensure that our software works correctly. They help catch issues early, leading to fewer problems later on. 

Three benefits of testing are:
- Reduced defects
- Smoother project development
- Improved code quality

Individual pitfalls include:
- Forgetting to run tests
- Writing too many or trivial tests

Team pitfalls include:
- Partial adoption of testing
- Poor maintenance of the test suite

## CI/CD

Benefits of Continuous Integration (CI):
- Early detection of integration issues
- Faster feedback on code quality and functionality
- Improved collaboration and coordination among developers

Difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment:
- Continuous Delivery: Software is always ready for deployment but requires manual approval.
- Continuous Deployment: Software is automatically deployed to production without manual intervention.

GitHub's role in the process:
GitHub is a platform where developers store and collaborate on code. It integrates with CI/CD tools to automate building, testing, and deployment.
