## Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

**Q: What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

A: The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event-Driven Programming is called EventEmitter.

**Q: What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

A: Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in combination with Event-Driven Programming promotes a modular and organized code structure. It enables the creation of reusable and loosely coupled components, facilitating communication through events.

**Q: Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

A: Event-Driven Programming in Node.js, similar to how events work in a web browser, allows applications to respond to events. For example, in a chat application, when a user joins, an event can be triggered to alert others. Event Driven Programming makes the backend more dynamic, responsive, and organized. It enables different parts of the application to communicate effectively through events, resulting in better coordination and flexibility.
