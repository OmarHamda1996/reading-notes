# Stacks and Queues

## Stack

**What is a Stack data structure?**

A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last comes out first, while FILO implies that the element that is inserted first comes out last.

**Why use a Stack data structure?**

A stack data structure is used when the order of actions is important. It ensures that a system does not move onto a new action before completing the preceding ones.

**How to use a Stack data structure?**

To use a stack data structure, you can use an array or linked list. The array implementation is simple and easy to implement but has a fixed size. The linked list implementation is more flexible and dynamic but requires more memory and overhead.

## Queue

**What is a Queue data structure?**

A queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) for Stack, and FIFO (First In First Out) for Queue.

**Why use a Queue data structure?**

A queue is used when we want to process elements in First In First Out order. It is useful when implementing a system that has to process tasks in the order they were received. For example, when printing documents in the order they were sent to the printer.

**How to use a Queue data structure?**

To use a queue data structure, you can use an array or linked list. The array implementation is simple and easy to implement but has a fixed size. The linked list implementation is more flexible and dynamic but requires more memory and overhead.
